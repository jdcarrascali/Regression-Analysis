# Regression-Analysis
Regression analysis course, Fall 2022, UNAL

In this repository you will find some applications of two approaches of regression analysis:

*[https://github.com/jdcarrascali/Regression-Analysis/tree/main/Examenes%20escritos](*Answers to theoretical exams*): Derivation of estimators, revision of the theory and proofs.
*[https://github.com/jdcarrascali/Regression-Analysis/blob/main/Primera_entrega_proyecto.pdf](*Description*) Initial plan of analysis, variables, source of the data, general porpuses of the study and definition of statistical units.
*[https://github.com/jdcarrascali/Regression-Analysis/blob/main/Segunda_entrega_proyecto.pdf](*Classic multiple regression analysis aproach:*) We made use of statistical tools such as hypothesis testing, exploratory analysis, LAD and classic regression to answer questions related with the price of a car based on some of its features.
*[https://github.com/jdcarrascali/Regression-Analysis/blob/main/Tercera_entrega_proyecto.pdf](*Statistical learning approach:*) We made use of Lasso, GAM and Ridge regression to predict the price of a car comparing its results with the classical regression counterpart and performing feature selection techniques to decrease variance. Also we developed and example of binary classification task using logistic regression.
